        <h2>Ongoing killing in Palestine</h2>

        <p>
        The conflict between Israel and Palestinians — rooted in decades of tensions over land, 
        governance, and rights — <b>escalated sharply on 7 October 2023 </b>after Hamas attacks and subsequent Israeli military operations. 
        This has led to intense and prolonged fighting, especially in the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank.
        </p>
        <ul>
  <h2>Violence and Killings of Palestinians</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Large numbers of civilian casualties in Gaza
        <ul>
          <li>Israeli military operations in and around Gaza have continued intermittently, with air strikes and artillery fire killing dozens to hundreds of Palestinians at a time in recent months.</li>
          <li>These attacks have often occurred despite ceasefire agreements, with reports of violations leading to renewed violence.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Recent reported deaths
        <ul>
          <li>According to recent reports, Israeli strikes and shelling have killed dozens of Palestinians, including children, in multiple incidents across Gaza.</li>

      </li>
      <li>Ongoing risks and rights concerns
        <ul>
          <li>Human rights organizations and the United Nations have expressed concern about ongoing violations against civilians, including killings, restricted humanitarian aid, and damage to civilian infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <h2>Specific documented incidents</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Rafah paramedic massacre (March 2025): At least 15 Palestinian medics were killed when humanitarian vehicles were struck in southern Rafah, Gaza.</li>
